How to use:

**Choose a Color**
1. You can type any 3 or 6 digit hex-value (both lower and uppercase work)
2. Select (keyboard input) from these colors:

|        |           |        |
| ------ | --------- | ------ |
| red    | orange    | yellow |
| lime   | limegreen | green  |
| blue   | skyblue   | violet |
| purple | black     | brown  |
| gray   | grey      | white  |
| pink   |           |        |
|        |           |        |

3. Use ChatGPT!
   - Try something like "sunset" and ChatGPT will try its best with coming up with a color most similar to the subject


**Send it!**
- Simply hit the [Enter] key and the screen should update.


_Note: This is the public repository version of the app, and the code available in this project is not directly functional without some required packages such as node.js, and a valid ChatGPT API key._
